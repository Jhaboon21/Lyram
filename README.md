## GameDescription 🎻🎻
The game is a 2D platforming, side-scroller where you play as the character, Darlyn. You utilize instruments such as the Flute, French Horn, Clarinet, Cello, and Lyre to navigate the world and solve puzzles in order to defeat the boss. The instruments will have unique abilities that will assist the player in their journey. The game will feature puzzles that can only be solved by using the correct instrument to progress.

## Backstory ⏮️⏮️
Darlyn is a young girl who is a music protoge. She lives with her father, Fernan, who creates musical instruments. Darlyn's mother, Taylor, had already passed away when Darlyn was 10. One day, Fernan created an instrument in his grief that was so imbuned with his love and sorrow for his wife, that it had the ability to move the hearts of those that heard it. However, Fernan discovered that it's real effect was to project the user's emotions and intent onto the audience. Fernan feared that the instrument might be misused and sealed it away. An evil terrorist group learned of this instrument and decided to steal it and use it for terror. One day, as Darlyn was in town, the terrorist group comes into Fernan's home and kills Fernan and steals the instrument. Darlyn comes home after the group has long left and discovers her dying father and learns of what has happened by reading through his dying notes. She decides to get back what was stolen and stop the evil terrorists.

## Gameplay System 🎮🕹️
The player is a lone girl that must go up against an evil terrorist group. It would be ill advised to try and fight the enemy in a head-on confrontation, so instead, Darlyn would utilized her instruments to traverse paths that are hidden behind puzzles to get the jump on the enemy. There will be puzzle mechanics that require certain instruments to be collected and used to solve. Certain enemy and boss mechanics must be countered with certain instruments to progress as well.
